            On a sunny day, a chicken was very proud to be a chicken and its pride caused it to yell,"REVOLUTIONIZE CHICKEN!!" 
            A hungry human being comprehended this statement incorrectly and next thing you see is.....the hero chicken became a barbecued Chicken..and this hero was never forgotten.
            This is when the real revolution started, and when it did, the chicken society arose higher and higher. We are tired of seeing our brothers and sisters becoming fried eggs
            before they have even seen life! We have declared war! It will not end until humans are fried as well!
